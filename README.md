# Sync
C++23 module that allows declaring arbitrary thread synchronization schemes as objects in memory. These objects may be passed a function, and arguments expected by that function, to invoke them in the synchronized contexts they describe.

Written in Visual Studio 2022 CE, compiled with the preview build of C++23 `(/std:c++latest)`.
